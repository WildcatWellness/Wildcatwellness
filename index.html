    <h2>Unplug</h2>
    <p class="titleStatement">Limit your consumption of social media and the 24-hour news cycle. It is important to stay informed, but creating boundaries is critical to your overall well-being.</p>
    <div>
      <h3>Are you feeling stressed & overwhelmed by everything going on in our society today?</h3>
      <p>If so, you are not alone.  COVID-19, the election, and the national discourse around race and equality are a lot to cope with all at once.  This guide is meant to provide resources to help you take care of yourself during our current climate.  It is not a political statement or judgement of opinion.  Use the live links in this document to explore different ways to maintain your well-being.</p>

      <h3>Stay Informed - Be Engaged - Know your limits - Unplug When Needed</h3>
      <p>It is important to be informed, but equally important to unplug from the 24-hour news cycle.  Monitor how you feel after news consumption and conversations about politics.  Feeling preoccupied or even upset by national events may be a sign to cut back on your news intake and limit social media discussions.  Finding a balance between being involved, making your voice heard, and taking care of yourself emotionally can be difficult.  Setting good boundaries is an important step in taking care of yourself and maintaining civil discourse.</p>

  <article id="present">
    <h2>Be Present</h2>
    <p class="titleStatement">Use reflection to recognize your inner thoughts and feelings. Be curi-ous and non- judgmental and give yourself permission to feel the way you do. Although some avoiding can be useful, “stuffing” or ignoring strong emotions can have negative impacts.</p>
  </article>
  <article id="refuel">
    <h2>Refuel</h2>
    <p class="titleStatement">Focus on restoring yourself with rest and healthy food. Drink water and try to limit caffeine. Move a little every day. Take a walk; look at the sky ; be in nature. Journal or meditate. Make art or watch funny videos. Read something fun.</p>
  </article>
  <article id="connect">
    <h2>Connect</h2>
    <p class="titleStatement">Engage with supportive friends and allies. Talk about current issues, if needed, but be aware of when you are feeling overwhelmed. Not everyone will share your perspective, so it is OK to limit your topics and avoid heated conflict. Reach out to supportive services on- campus, including Counseling Services.</p>
  </article>
  <article id="do-something">
    <h2>Do Something</h2>
    <p class="titleStatement">Channel what you are feeling into positive, meaningful activity. Be informed and proactive around issues that matter to you. Find ways to engage in your community through advocacy in ways that fit for you individually.</p>
