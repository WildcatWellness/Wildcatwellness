    <h2>Unplug</h2>
    <p class="titleStatement">Limit your consumption of social media and the 24-hour news cycle. It is important to stay informed, but creating boundaries is critical to your overall well-being.</p>
    <div>
      <h3>Are you feeling stressed & overwhelmed by everything going on in our society today?</h3>
      <p>If so, you are not alone. COVID-19, the election, and the national discourse around race and equality are a lot to cope with all at once.  This guide is meant to provide resources to help you take care of yourself during our current climate.  It is not a political statement or judgement of opinion.  Use the live links in this document to explore different ways to maintain your well-being.</p>

      <h3>Stay Informed - Be Engaged - Know your limits - Unplug When Needed</h3>
      <p>It is important to be informed, but equally important to unplug from the 24-hour news cycle.  Monitor how you feel after news consumption and conversations about politics.  Feeling preoccupied or even upset by national events may be a sign to cut back on your news intake and limit social media discussions.  Finding a balance between being involved, making your voice heard, and taking care of yourself emotionally can be difficult.  Setting good boundaries is an important step in taking care of yourself and maintaining civil discourse.</p>
