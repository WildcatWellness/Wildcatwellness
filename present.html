        <p class="titleStatement">Use reflection to recognize your inner thoughts and feelings. Be curi-ous and non- judgmental and give yourself permission to feel the way you do. Although some avoiding can be useful, “stuffing” or ignoring strong emotions can have negative impacts.</p>

Be present in your conversations with friends, family, classmates, and others.  It is okay to talk about difficult subjects; such as politics, racial inequality, COVID-19, or anything else that feels difficult for you.  Use “I” statements to convey your thoughts and feelings.  Be curious about others opinions and be confident in yours.  If you are unsure about something someone says, clarify, do not make assumptions.  Acknowledge your understanding of what others say, even if you disagree.  Acknowledgement does not mean agreement!  And, most importantly, know when to end the conversation and how to set your boundaries.</p>
